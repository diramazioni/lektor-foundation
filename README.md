Zurb Foundation 6 starter theme for Lektor. Preview here: http://w1.hewlohost.com/~joythewizard/

Hi, I've never worked with a static site generator before, so this is my first time working with Jinja2. Some parts of the site are currently hardcoded, but I'd like to move to get rid of those areas. Also, since this is my first time working with a static site generator, this project is a way for me to learn the ropes, meaning I'll fumble in some (if not many) areas. I'd love some help and I hope this project helps out anyone interested in Lektor. 

##Sass
This theme uses sass, but if you would rather use vanilla CSS, you can use the compiled foundation-sites.css file included and delete the sass components.
