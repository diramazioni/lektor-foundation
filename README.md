# lektor-foundation
This is a Zurb Foundation 6 (http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) theme for the Lektor static content management system (http://getlektor.com). To get started, download the theme, navigate to the location where you downloaded it, and run "lektor server" for a preview. The "Kitchen Sink" page contains demonstrations of each of the components implemented through flow blocks.

### Things to Note

If you use this theme, you don't have to run "lektor quickstart" because this theme is already a Lektor project itself. Head into the "site.lektorproject" file and make sure you change the name of the project. You can also choose to change the "site.lektorproject" file name to something like "mysite.lektorproject" as long as you keep the ".lektorproject" ending.

### Templates

The main layout file was edited to provide a base, but there isn't much to be seen in this section right now. However, in the future, I plan on adding a couple base page templates. My main focus currently is adding Foundation components as flow blocks.

### Components

The theme currently has the following components implemented through flow blocks:

- Accordion
- Callout
- Modal
- Slider
- Table
- Tabs
- etc.

More information on the theme and components can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/joyhchen/lektor-foundation/wiki).
